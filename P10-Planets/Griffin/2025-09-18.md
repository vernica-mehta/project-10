For He we have Free–free and Bound–free
For He+ we have Free–free and Bound–free

$\sigma_{ff}(He) = \sigma_{ff}(H) (assumed)$
$\sigma_{ff}(He+) = \sigma_{ff}(H) (assumed)$

```python 
HeIff = Hff(nu, T_val) 
HeIIff = Hff(nu, T_val) 
```

and we have a function for HeIbf(nu, T)

What is left with to complete HeIIbf(nu,T). This

Function coming soon :) 
```python 
def HeIIbf()



```
