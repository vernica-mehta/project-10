### Task 1 - Locate literature values for the state of the exoplanet

The main three parameters of the exoplanet we need is the effective temperature $T_{eff}$, Albedo, gravity $g$ and density $\rho$.

The exoplanet type of interest is a gas giant, specifically jupiter like. In Sanchez-Lavega et al., 2019, the paper goes into the general properties of the gas giants within our solar systems. Temperatures range considerably based on the planet type looked at, for the icy giants like Neptune and Uranus, $T_{eff}$ are nearly identical sitting at 59.3K and 59.1K respectively whereas there is a considerable difference in $T_{eff}$  for Jupiter and Saturn having 
$T_eff$ of 124.4K and 95K respectively.
