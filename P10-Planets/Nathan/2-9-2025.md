# 2/9/2025 - Understanding the Major Project Topic

Goal is to read through the textbook chapter 17 to get a better understanding/grasp of the project topic and potential ways of tackling the project. I will also discuss main terms like the grey/gray atmosphere, LTE, etc. to improve my understanding of these terms.

Chapters are from the 'Theory of Stellar Atmospheres' by Ivan Hubeny and Dimitri Milhalas

## Chapter 17.7 - Models with External Irradiation

### Exact Solution (linearization method)
This chapter discusses mainly stellar atmospheres, but most likely most of the content can be used for exoplanet atmospheres.

For numerical models, external irradiation is easily added by making external rays be non-zero, i.e. make specific intensity at the surface ($\tau = 0$) with negative $\mu$ be non-zero. This will change the Feautrier variables j and h which are defined within the definitions section.

Using the definition of the Feautrier variable j at the upper boundary, we have the new boundary condition  (17.224):

$$\mu (\delta j_{\mu\nu}/\delta\tau_\nu)_0 = j_{\mu\nu}(\tau_\nu = 0) - \xi^-_{\nu} $$

$$\mu (\delta j_{\mu\nu}/\delta\tau_\nu)_0 = j_{\mu\nu}(\tau_\nu = 0) - I_{\mu\nu}^{ext}$$

Multiplying both sides by $\mu$ and integrating from 0 to 1 gives:

$$\frac{\delta K}{\delta\tau_\nu} = \int^1_0j_{\mu\nu}(\tau_\nu = 0) - \mu I_{\mu\nu}^{ext} = \int^1_0j_{\mu\nu}(\tau_\nu = 0) - H_\nu^{ext}$$

From this we can obtain an exact solution for the model in LTE, though we can also achieve an approximate solution using the grey atmosphere. 

### Pseudo-grey model (p. 628)

As this is a grey model, all variables operate irrelevant to frequency, this is gone into more detail within the definitions section. The frequency independent moment equations are:

$$dH/dz = - (\kappa_J J - \kappa_B B)\; \; \;  first \; moment \; DE$$
$$dK/dz = -\chi_H H \; \; \; second \; moment \; DE$$

where $\kappa_J$ and $\kappa_B$ are the absorption mean and the Planck mean opacities. As this system is thermodynamic equilibrium, the first moment differential equation must be 0 by the definition of the eddington flux H as $H \equiv \sigma_R T_{eff}^4/4\pi$, thus $dH/dz \equiv 0$. Therefore the mean intensty is linked to the planck function:

$$B = (\kappa_J/\kappa_B)J$$


 We need all three moments for the model, the zeroth moment J (the mean intensity) by solving the second moment DE:

$$K(\tau_H) = H\tau_H + K(0), \; \;\; \tau_H = -\chi_H dz $$

$\tau_H$ is the optical depth associated with the flux mean opacity. Substituting $H = B$ and $K = fJ$ where $f$ is the Eddington factor $f \equiv K/J$:

$$J(\tau_H) = \left[\frac{\sigma_R T_{eff}^4}{4\pi} \tau_H + K(0)\right] \times \frac{1}{f}$$

Taking the two stream approximation (p. 572 - 573), the moments of radiative transfer are defined as:

$$J(\tau) = \frac{1}{2}[I^+(\tau) + I^-({\tau})]$$

$$H(\tau) = \frac{\mu_0}{2}[I^+(\tau) - I^-({\tau})]$$

$$K(\tau) = \frac{\mu_0^2}{2}[I^+(\tau) + I^-({\tau})]$$

At $\tau = 0$:

$$ H(0) = \frac{\mu_0}{2}[I^+(0) - I^-(0)]$$

Rearranging:

$$I^+ = I^- + 2H(0)/\mu_0 = I^{ext} + 2H_0/\mu_0$$

Subsitituting into $K(\tau)$ at $\tau = 0$:

$$K(0) =\frac{\mu_0^2}{2}[I^+(0) + I^-({0})] = \mu_0^2[I^{ext} + H_0/\mu_0] $$

The book defines the external radiation as the Planck distribution at an irradiation temperature $T_{irr}$ multiplied by a dilution factor $W$. Substituting this into the equation for $J(\tau_H)$:

$$J(\tau_H) = \left[\frac{\sigma_R T_{eff}^4}{4\pi} \tau_H + \mu_0^2[WB(T_{irr}) + H_0/\mu_0]\right] \times \frac{1}{f}$$

$f = \mu_0^2$ from the definition of $f$ and $K(\tau)$ allows us to simplify 

$$J(\tau_H) = \left[\frac{\sigma_R T_{eff}^4}{4\pi f} \tau_H + W(\sigma_R/\pi) T_{irr}^4+ H_0/\mu_0\right]$$

The temperature profile can be approximated to



## Definitions
### Feautrier Method and Feautrier variables (11.76, 11.83, 11.148)
Requires two boundary conditions, in the textbook, they use a squashed I like symbol, I could not find the exact one in latex so I will choose a different one to supplement it ($\xi$). The boundary conditions for the Feutrier method for a finite planar slab is:

$$I_\nu(\tau_\nu = 0, -\mu) \equiv \xi_\nu^-(-\mu), \;\;\;\;\; (0 \leq \mu \leq 1)$$

$$I_\nu(\tau_\nu = \tau_0, \mu) \equiv \xi_\nu^+(\mu), \;\;\;\;\; (0 \leq \mu \leq 1)$$

These boundary conditions are strictly met for the Feautrier method, two variables j and h are defined for the upper boundary as:

$$h_{\mu\nu}(\tau = 0) = j_{\mu\nu}(\tau = 0) - \xi_\nu^-(0,-\mu), \;\;\; (0\leq\mu\leq1)$$

This is taken from the form of the Milne boundary conditions at 11.83 within the textbook where h and j are specific intensity. If there was no external radiation, $\xi_\nu^-(0,-\mu) \equiv 0$, for this case then:

$$h_{\mu\nu}(\tau = 0) \equiv j_{\mu\nu}(\tau = 0)$$

Then:

$$\mu (\delta j_{\mu\nu}/\delta\tau_\nu)_0 = j_{\mu\nu}(\tau_\nu = 0) $$

### Grey/Gray atmosphere

### Local Thermodynamic Equilibrium

### Moments of Radiative Transfer

### Radiative mean and Planck mean opacities

The Planck mean opacity weights the absorption coefficient $\kappa_nu$ by the normalised planck distribution function:

$$\kappa_B = \frac{\int^\infty_0 \kappa_\nu B d\nu}{\int^\infty_0 Bd\nu} = \frac{\pi}{\sigma_K T^4} \int^{\infty}_0 \kappa_\nu Bd\nu$$

### Dilution factor
