> [!Abstract]  
> 
> Photoionization cross sections form part of the basic data for energy balance and radiation transfer processes in the fields of aeronomy, astrophysics, and plasma physics. Since considerable theoretical effort has now been invested in the development of calculations, there is a need for reliable absolute atomic cross sections for comparison in order to judge the desirability of calculations on atoms and ions which are difficult to study quantitatively in the laboratory. Experimental data are now available for the lighter inert gases. The present paper presents tabulations of recommended values based on critically evaluated results from a number of recent experiments.
