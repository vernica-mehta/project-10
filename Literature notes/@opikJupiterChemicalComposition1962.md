> A comprehensive analysis is made of the observational and theoretical information regarding the composition, structure, and origin of Jupiter, viewed as a cosmogonic test case of a giant planet. With a polychromatic radiative-equilibrium temperature of 112 ± 2 °K, based on the radiative properties of ammonia and methane as the chief radiators, the occultation of σ Arietis yields a mean molecular weight of μ = 4.3 ± 0.5 for Jupiter's atmosphere. The combination of the optical properties of Jupiter's disk with spectroscopically determined abundances of molecular hydrogen, methane, and ammonia leads to probable percentages of molecules in Jupiter's observable atmosphere as f follows: MoleculeHeH2NeCH4ANH3%97.22.30.390.0630.0420.0029 This gives another independent value of the mean molecular weight of μ = 4.02, in fair agreement with the occultation value. Free nitrogen is excluded by considerations of chemical equilibrium. CO2 must be completely reduced to CH4 and H2O, whereas water is snowing out and cannot appear above Jupiter's cloud level. The solid ammonia hypothesis of the clouds is strongly supported. The temperature at cloud top is 156 °K, and the probable pressure 11 atmospheres. From radiometric observations, as well as from the independent evidence of the temperature of the ammonia clouds, an internal heat supply for Jupiter is indicated, of the order of 1.2 x 104 erg/cm2 sec or 1.+-0.4 times the solar input. For Saturn the internal heat supply is of the order of 4 x 103 erg/cm2 sec, almost the double of solar input. If the bulk of Jupiter's mass is solid hydrogen, its atmospheric composition is very different. Escape and diffusion processes from a rotating preplanetary nebular ring, as well as from planetary exospheres are analyzed and numerically evaluated. These processes, of neutral as well as ionized gas, are utterly inadequate to account for any significant differentiation of composition on a cosmic or planetary scale. It is shown that differentiation by condensation of solid particles, especially snowing-out of hydrogen from the nebular ring, is quantitatively adequate to achieve concentration of hydrogen in the core of a Jovian planet, as well as to lead to the subsequent accretion of a helium atmosphere. The solid hydrogen-helium model of Jupiter's internal structure is shown to be the only one in harmony with observation and theory. The alternative of a gaseous sphere of heavier elements (C-N-O) is examined and shown definitely to contradict crucial observational data, especially surface temperature which should then be of the order of 104 °K. Such a sphere would rapidly cool by convection and become a solid-degenerate body of much higher density than that of Jupiter. The bulk of Jupiter's mass could have originated either directly by accretion of hydrogen snow from the ring, of course, vaporizing before reaching the surface of the planet maintained at a temperature of the order of 3000–4000 °K; or through an intermediate stage of a gasball, contracting through convectional cooling. Cooling b by radiative and conductive transfer is far too slow for gasballs of Jupiter's mass.
