Hi Griff,

  

It has been a busy weekend, and just getting back to emails. The big picture is that there is nothing in my code that should work at anything like 50K. Molecules form at ~2000K at high pressure, and nothing I gave you were meant to be in this <2000K regime. I discussed some of these complexities in the Thursday lecture.  Any realistic equation of state would have to just assume ideal gas with e.g. H2 and He as the dominant components.

  

Opacities at low temperatures are very complex, as I’m sure you’ve realised!

  
Mike.

Worked around it by just allowing the error to throw a warning instead 
```python 
except Exception as e:

# Fall back to Saha-only on failure

print(f"Warning: Molecular equilibrium failed at T={T_K}K: {e}")

print(" Falling back to Saha-only")
```

and 

```python
if not res.success:

print(f"WARNING: Equilibrium solver did not converge!")

print(f" T={T}, rho={rho}")
```

This allowed the code to run through but alot of it didn't converge :(  and I don't have the time to fix it. Most likely either due to the saha equation not doing well under low temps or intial conditions.As mike said low temps are hard :) 

This left me with the final bit of code:
seen on the github: https://github.com/vernica-mehta/project-10

Alot of the eos.py code is influenced by mikes code ! 

For the presentation:

 Using this plot as its the best I have:
