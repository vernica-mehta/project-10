Discussed with mike about loading in compostion: 

His suggestion 

- You revisited the _EoS / opacity structure_ code, which loads tables describing molecular and elemental abundances (H, He, CH₄, NH₃, etc.).

- The tables originate from **Tsuji’s fitting coefficients**, derived from Gibbs free energy–based equilibrium constants (log K = log (p_products / p_reactants)).

Functional form taken from Tsuji is a **4th-order polynomial in θ = 5040/T**, corresponding to Gibbs free energy–based equilibrium relations.

EoS calculates **mean molecular weight** and composition through equilibrium between atoms and molecules

Discussed how to convert molecular percentages to elemental abundances:

It was what i was thinking see [[Notes from dicussions and working out.pdf]]

basically just - Multiply each molecular fraction by the number of atoms of each element it contains, then normalise so total atomic fractions sum to 1.

- Plan to simplify: start with the $\ce{H <=> H2}$ equilibrium to visualise transition with temperature before expanding to multiple species.
