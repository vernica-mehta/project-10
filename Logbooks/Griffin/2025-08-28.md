Me trying to figure out how things worked :)

# Code Breakdown 

#### Structure.py 



```python
def T_tau(tau, Teff):

"""

Temperature for a simplified grey atmosphere, with an analytic

approximation for the Hopf q (feel free to check this!)

"""

q = 0.71044 - 0.1*np.exp(-2.0*tau)

T = (0.75*Teff**4*(tau + q))**.25

return T
```



**Rosseland mean opacity** -> created fits file via opac.py

Rosseland mean opacity is the harmonic opacity mean (i.e. inverse of average mean free path), weighted by the Planck function derivative,The deep atmosphere can always be considered “grey” as long as the Rosseland mean opacity is used.  -> This comes lecture 5 slides. 

$$
\frac{1}{\chi_R}=\int_0^\infty{\frac{1}{\chi_R}\frac{dB_{\nu}}{dT}d\nu/\frac{dB_{\nu}}{dT}}
$$


```python
#Create our interpolator functions
f_kappa_bar_Ross = RegularGridInterpolator((Ps_log10, T_grid), kappa_bar_Ross)
```

Pressure balance 
```python 
def dPdtau(_, P, T):

"""

Compute the derivative of pressure with respect to optical depth.

"""

kappa_bar = f_kappa_bar_Ross((np.log10(P), T))

return g / kappa_bar
```






```python 

def T_tau(tau, Teff,Flux,Albedo):

"""

Temperature for a simplified grey atmosphere, with an analytic

approximation for the Hopf q (feel free to check this!)

"""

q = 0.71044 - 0.1*np.exp(-2.0*tau)

# added temp

T = (0.75*Teff**4*(tau + q))**.25+(1-Albedo)*Flux

return T

```


# In Class 

Zotero project created so we can easily group all sources together
- Discussing possible methods for tackling project
- Textbook has grey atmosphere approximation for externally irradiated atmospheres
- planet structure considered to be gas giant, Vernica provided a paper that discusses processes of externally irradiated atmosphere of gas giant
    - Model from paper takes non-LTE effects into account, might be too complex of a starting point
- Looking at provided code, specifically structure.py file. We plan too look over the code to see how it works
- We aim to neglect convection due to the problem being too complex to add, possibly might come back to it if we have time.

For pseudo-grey model, we need to know the temp, g and rho of planet. Albedo of the planet remains fixed and will come from literature. We aim to find how the temperature of the planet is affected by the external radiation field.

We discuss 3 main tasks to split between the three of this:

- Fixing the temperature code so that it works
- Finding literature values for temperature, g and density of exoplanets
- Changing code so that it becomes an exoplanet instead of a star
