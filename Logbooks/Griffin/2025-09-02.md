From the group meeting today: 

At this stage, we have a finalised equation for the simple pseudo-gray model planet atmosphere.

$$T^4(\tau_H)=\frac{\kappa_J}{\kappa_B}\frac{3}{4}T_{eff}^4\left[\tau_H+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}+\frac{4W}{3}\left(\frac{T_{irr}}{T_{eff}}\right)^4\right]$$

Where for the pseudo-gray atmosphere, $\kappa_J/\kappa_B=1$, and $W=(r_\ast/D)^2\times{f}$, where $f=1/2$ for the stellar radiation being evenly spread over the hemisphere of the planet. The only part we are unsure about at the moment is $\tau_H$, and we need to look further to understand exactly how it is dependent on the atmosphere of the exoplanet.

We have broken the next part of the project down into three components for us to work on this week:

- Griffin: finish the code for `T_tau`, where an input tau grid outputs temperature
- Vernica: look into $\tau_H$ and apply this to the function, testing the `structure.py` code to get some initial model results
- Nathan: look beyond the grey atmosphere model, into what we need to do to model non-grey atmosphere


Right after our meeting I updated the temperature function to include 

```python
def T_tau(tau_h, Teff,Tirr,kappa_j,kappa_b,f,Distance_from_sun):

"""
Temperature for a simplified grey atmosphere

"""
r_solar = c.R_sun.value

W = f*(r_solar/Distance_from_sun)**2

brackets = tau_h + 1/np.sqrt(3)+4*W/3*(Tirr/Teff)**4

T = (kappa_j/kappa_b)*3/4*Teff**4*(brackets)

return T
```
