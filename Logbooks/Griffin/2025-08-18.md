Major project I am considering: 

1) Project 10: Compute the emergent spectrum of an externally-irradiated atmosphere (like a giant exoplanet). It will be hard to make this realistic, because of the opacities needed.
2) Project 11: Extend the spectrum computation code to cooler atmospheres (i.e. M giants or M dwarfs... brown dwarfs and exoplanets are probably a step too far).
3) Project 2: Create a stellar structure code that merges photosphere models with an internal structure code based on material covered in ASTR2013 and ASTR3007 (basic internal structure code provided).

I am majorly interested in project 10 due to the planetary nature of it and the fact that I have chemical models of Venus vertical atmosphere using Caltech kinetics 1D model:
