Discussion from today:

- Helped fixed the grey atmosphere -> Vernica was having trouble with the planck function Where it was coming as wan't really looking like a black body for the incoming radiation, Working together we found since Venica had the temperatures all being the same in an array the code would calculate each planck function for each temperature of the array which and since the code would add them together  this caused the weird result we were seeing in final spectrum. 

The fix was to reduce the calculation down to only one temp that was calculated. 

We also opted for a closer in model of Jupiter since 


We also Discussed the non grey atmosphere. My understanding is that for the non grey atmosphere the major part of that will be adjusting the ratio of thermal opacities to visuals,
Are the kappas only related to planet thermal opacties or are they influenced by the irraition as well ? 
$$
T^{4}(\tau_{H})= \frac{\kappa_j}{\kappa_b}\frac{3}{4}T_{eff}^4 (\tau_H+\frac{1}{\sqrt{3}}+\frac{4W}{3}(\frac{T_{irr}}{T_{eff}})^4)
$$

This mess of drawings came from me clarifying my understanding on the non-grey atmosphere and grey atmosphere. As well as my understanding on opacities. And dicussion with Maya about calculating line opacities.

My understanding of the opacties now:

Continuum opacities they make up the shape of the line and they are the built from the addition of each elements Ionisation transitions and bound-bound transitions

As getting absorption lines one why historically and suggested during our conversation was the random bands model where lines were randomly placed to approximate low-res spectra.

Now If we wanted to do it properly we would have to solve the radiation transport equation numerically. 

But possibly a simpler way to do it due to the time constraints would be to just calculate the major lines individually. 

My understanding on how the simplest way to do that would be using beer lambert's law where: 

Light of wavelength $\lambda$ traversing an absorbing column obeys
$$

I(\lambda) = I_0(\lambda)*(1 - exp(-\tau(\lambda)))

$$
where
$$

\tau(\lambda) \;=\;\int_{z_0}^{\infty} \sigma\!\bigl(\lambda,T(z)\bigr)\,n(z)\,dz

\quad\bigl[\text{dimensionless}\bigr].

$$

* $( I_0(\lambda) )$ – incident irradiance at the cloud‑top interface.

* $( \sigma(\lambda,T) cm^{2})$ – monochromatic absorption cross‑section (lab‑derived).

* $( n(z) ,[\mathrm{cm^{-3}}] )$ – number density profile of the coulmn density from literature 

* $( \tau )$ – optical depth 

And we can calculate this for each line. 

For our crossections databases we can use to get the absorption crossections for the lines come from: 

- **HITRAN** (300 K, IR focus; now expanded to other temps/wavelengths).
- **HITEMP** (high-T extension of HITRAN).

Note -> in my original conversation in the notes above I thought we would be calculating kappa which would then use in our temp profile but I think now the kappa_j and kappa_b are to do with the planets own thermal opacities ????? 

On this note I had: 
>[!note]
>Not to sure what to do with the strong line and weak line functions and for now I am going to wait till class to do either He- or He++ as I am not to sure what one. 

I assume its function is to calculate the lines in a more in depth manor then what I suggested above. 

-> added this as part of my question for mike. see [[2025-09-17]]

Questions that came out of it (taken from maya email):

Dear Mike,

We were discussing the project 10 a little bit and have a question for you regarding the project scope. Would it be a correct approach if the external irradiation is taken into account for the continuum calculation, and then to treat the lines correctly we could adopt some external opacities for molecules (similarly as in Problem Set 2, I reckon?)

Or should the opacities for molecules be calculated from first principles (at least in some capacity – because I expect calculating that for all relevant molecules is beyond the scope of this project)?

Griffin, Vernica, Nathan, I will read up on this more so that we can discuss more on Thursday.
"

Solved issue Vernica was having with the Planck function and the irradiated spectrum. Opted to use a closer distance to the star to simulate a hot jupiter due to the irradiation of jupiter being negligible.

Nathan explained the non-grey model, confusion is around the picket fence model and the thermal opacities. The model can be coded up to take the irradiated temperature and the visual opacities. We can manipulate the ratio of thermal opacities (i.e. $R = \kappa_1/\kappa_2$ which are the picket fence opacities $\kappa_1$ and $\kappa_2$) to see how this affects the temperature profile of the planet.
