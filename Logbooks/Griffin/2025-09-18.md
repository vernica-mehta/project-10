For He we have Free–free and Bound–free
For He+ we have Free–free and Bound–free

$\sigma_{ff}(He) = \sigma_{ff}(H) (assumed)$
$\sigma_{ff}(He+) = \sigma_{ff}(H) (assumed)$

```python 
HeIff = Hff(nu, T_val) 
HeIIff = Hff(nu, T_val) 
```

and we have a function for HeIbf(nu, T)

What is left with to complete HeIIbf(nu,T). This

Function coming soon :)
```python 
def HeIIbf()



```

From conversation with Frank mills: 

 **Continuum vs. Line Absorption:**

- Once atoms or molecules reach the ionization threshold, the absorption becomes _continuous_ because electrons can occupy any energy above the threshold.
- Discrete **molecular line absorption** occurs when electrons are promoted between quantized energy levels.
- At **high pressures**, frequent collisions broaden and merge individual lines, forming a _quasi-continuum_.
- Thus, all opacity originates from line transitions, but depending on the regime (pressure, temperature, ionization), it appears as discrete lines, bands, or continuum.

**Molecular Bands and Historical Approximations:**
- In molecular gases (e.g. CO₂, H₂O), dense forests of lines blend into broad absorption bands.
- Historically, due to computational limits, **random band models** were used (1950s–1980s). These assumed random placement of lines to approximate low-resolution spectra — adequate when individual lines couldn’t be resolved.

**Modern Approaches:**
- Today, full **line-by-line radiative transfer** is computationally feasible for static or small-scale models.
- Large-scale GCMs still use approximations — treating line cores accurately and band wings as continuum (e.g., correlated-k or opacity distribution functions).
