During class I discussed my ideas around project 10 

Key takeaways:

- It will be hard to make this realistic, because of the opacities needed
- Vernica and I discussed the scope and ideas for the project, still looking for 3rd member
- Think of doing something Jupiter like being irrated by a sun like star. 
- can most likely take solar spectrum from provided code, 
- need to discuss with Mike on Thursday about the scope of this project and what we discussed today
