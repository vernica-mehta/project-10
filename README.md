# ASTR4022 Project: Computing the Spectrum of a Giant Exoplanet

**Project Number:** 10

**Group Members:** Griffin, Nathan, Vernica

## Repo Organisation

We have approached this project by considering multiple models for the computation of a planetary spectrum, which are organised into the subfolders of this repo. The main source code is `main.py`, which draws upon the models in the subfolders to generate spectra based on user inputs. Defaults assume a solar-like spectrum imposed on a Jupiter-like planet.
